Browser Filters
===============

Browser filters is a collection of three common filtering needs:

* UnicodeContentType: Set the charset to text/html; charset=utf-8 unless 
  something else has already been specified by the action.

* SafariUnicodeFix: Fix the unicode sent to the Safari browser under Ajax 
  calls to prevent garbage.
  
* LinkPrefetchingBlock: Block all pre-fetching requests by the Google Web
  Accelerator and others using a 403 Forbidden.
  
You can get all these filters applied at once by simply including BrowserFilters:

  class ApplicationController < ActiveRecord::Base
    include BrowserFilters
  end

...but you can also cherry-pick:

  class ApplicationController < ActiveRecord::Base
    include SafariUnicodeFix, LinkPrefetchingBlock
  end
